# GitHub Card Update Prompt

Please help me update the github_card.md file. This file documents discussions with my PI and other researchers. I need you to append text to the end answering th following onformation:
1. What work I completed this week
2. Why I did this work (motivation and purpose)
3. What I plan to do next

Please follow these steps in order:

1. First, read github_card.md to understand the current content and format
2. Read my personal weekly report: Home.md (2025-12-07 content)
3. Read the markdowns file in the ../ebi-weekly-report/ directory with time 2025-12-07
4. Based on this information, help me write new content for github_card.md at the bottom.

During the writing process, please ask me questions if you have any doubts about:
- Why I did certain specific tasks
- The reasoning behind certain technical decisions
- The priority or importance of the work
- Any details that need clarification
